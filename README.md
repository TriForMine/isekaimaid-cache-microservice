# Isekai Maid Cache Microservice
This is an external cache for my bot [Isekai Maid](https://www.isekaimaid.xyz).

It's using actix-web for accessing the cache.
And dashmap for storing the informations.

This is still work in progress, and doesn't work yet.

This is plugged in with [discordeno](https://github.com/discordeno/discordeno)
